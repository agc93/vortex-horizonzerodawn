  How to configure and customise your mods
---

### Customising metadata

You can customise the basic metadata of any of your mods (name, author, notes etc) using Vortex's built-in sidebar. Just double-click on the name of any mod in your mod list and you'll get a small dialog where you can change the name and author, or add some notes for yourself. It's not recommended to change the source or mod type as these control how mods are handled internally.

### Profiles

Just like any other Vortex game, you can have multiple profiles configured for different mod selections. Want an easier way to switch between certain outfit replacers? Don't want to use all your unbalanced tweaks every time you play? Set up profiles and you can easily switch between them to keep your mod installs separate. You can create a new profile from the Profiles screen by either cloning your exising one (from the Edit dropdown menu), or clicking *Add "Horizon Zero Dawn" Profile*.

### Purging to default

If you want to take your game back to a default, unmodded state, you can use Vortex's *Purge* feature. Click the Purge Mods button from the Mods list and Vortex will undeploy all your enabled mods, leaving your game directory essentially unmodded. 

### Removing or resetting HZDV

If you want to completely reset HZDV so that you can start over from scratch, first uninstall all your currently installed mods from the Mods list. Once you've done that (and deployed!) jump to the Profiles screen, and choose *Remove* from the dropdown menu beside the edit button for the "**Horizon Zero Dawn - Default**" profile. This will effectively reset your Vortex so that Horizon Zero Dawn will reappear as an available, unmanaged game in the Games list.

To remove HZDV entirely, you should uninstall and remove all your installed mods from the Mods list first. After deploying, you can then remove the Default profile (see above), and finally uninstall the extension itself by clicking over to the Extensions screen. HZDV will appear near the end of the list as "**Game: Horizon Zero Dawn**". Click Remove to uninstall HZDV.

> Note that Horizon Zero Dawn will still show up in your Games list since Vortex can redownload the extension from Nexus Mods.

### Multiple Installation Variants

If you don't like the specific file choices you made when you installed one of your mods, remember that you can always reinstall the mod and use Vortex's *variant* functionality to easily switch between multiple versions of the same mod without affecting the rest of your mod list.
